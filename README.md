### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
- The most important way to ensure that the software is functional and secure is in software testing. This includes not only the testing aspects that were covered throughout this course, but also in the use of secure coding tools to check for vulnerabilites and exploits before rolling the code into production. Doing testing in all these facets helps to ensure that the code is working and working as intended.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
- Interpreting user needs begins with their request. From the request, it is up to the development team to understand what the user wants and how to implement this into the code base to reflect the request. Further, once this implementation is designed and developed, it is important to test the code to ensure that it is meeting the requirements as specified in the request.

### How do I approach designing software?
- I approach designing software by first reviewing the requirements for the program that is to be written. I then brainstorm how to implement the requirements. From there I typically find myself doing research online as to the best way to do the implementations that I am thinking of doing. At this point I begin writing the program. I may have drafted a quick outline of the program by now. While writing the program, I keep close to the internet for resources on standard coding practices and other aspects of the process that I may need assistance on. Once the program is written, I then run tests to ensure that it is performing as expected before pushing the completed product to be submitted either as an assignment or a work project.
